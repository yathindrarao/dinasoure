# T-Rex game Bot
As you observe in the video the game is being played automatically by the computer itself and when we stop running the code the dinosaur dies. To do this I mainly focused on capturing the screen and giving the coordinates to the dinosaur (i.e in the form of pixels).
After that I created a box of size length 40 and height 32(this box is placed 50 pixels after the dinosaur) then I stored the color of each point in the box in the form of array using gray scale. when whole box is white the sum of each value in the array will be having a fixed value and when the color changes some in array changes and the difference in the colr can be computing by sum of array( when single value in the array changes the sum of array also changes). When there is color difference in the box dinosaur will automatically make a jump (PressSpace function), In this way you can make it automatic.
